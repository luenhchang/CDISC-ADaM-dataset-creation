Check if the branch exists in a local
```bash
git branch
* feature/my_first_fcn
  main
``` 
feature/my_first_fcn is your current branch (* indicates the current branch).
main is another local branch.

Check if the branch exists in a remote repository
```bash
git branch -r
# origin/1839-dummy-issue-for-onboarding
#  origin/2458_update_cheatsheet
#  origin/2468_derive_vars_crit_flag
#  origin/2481-bug-the-result-of-derive_param_tte-depends-on-the-sort-order-of-the-input
#  origin/2529_documentation_add_words_to_desription_2_functions
#  origin/2546_update_ABLFL_example_derive_var_base
#  origin/2563_no_list_columns
#  origin/2571_transform_range
#  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
#  origin/badges
#  origin/feature/my_first_fcn
#  origin/gh-pages
#  origin/main
#  origin/tidyselect-example
```
origin/feature/my_first_fcn exists on the remote repository.

Since origin/feature/my_first_fcn exists, you can safely push changes to it. If you’ve already set the upstream for this branch, you can simply run:
```bash
git push

@bms63
Just to confirm, I have made the following changes in this PR:

Updated the message in R/my_first_fcn.R from "Welcome to admiral!" to "Welcome to the admiral family!" to reflect a more inclusive tone.
The associated .Rd documentation in man/my_first_fcn.Rd has been updated accordingly.
